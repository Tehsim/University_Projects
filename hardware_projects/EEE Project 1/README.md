# Password-based-door-lock-system-using-arduino
This is my EEE project . IN where i implemented a password based door lock system using software and hardware. The hardware instruments are Arduino Uno,16×2 LCD display, 4×4 Matrix Keypad, Servo Motor, Breadboard and jumper wires  . And software are Proteus and Arduino IDE. IN proteus I did a simulation of my project.

The goal of this project is to analyze a suitable collection of
components for developing a smart door lock using Arduino Uno
that provides excellent security and quick access. In our daily
lives, safety is a major concern. Our security pattern includes an
access control system for doors. Traditional locks are no longer
as secure as they once were. We need to create a system that will
assist 24/7. Only authorized individuals will have the access.
Arduino is in charge of the entire system. This password-based
bolt structure will provide clients with a more secure and low�effort locking-opening mechanism. Mechanical door locks will
be replaced by electronic door locks in the future.
The following are the specific project goals:
 Familiarity with a smart door lock system based on a
microcontroller
 Using Arduino Uno to create a simple and smart door
locking system
